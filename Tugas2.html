	<h3>What is semantics?</h3>
	<p><span class="tes">Semantics</span> is the study of meaning. It is a wide subject within the general study of language. An understanding of semantics is essential to the study of <span class="tes">language acquisition</span> (how language users acquire a sense of meaning, as speakers and writers, listeners and readers) and of <span class="tes">language change</span> (how meanings alter over time). It is important for understanding <span class="tes">language in social contests</span>, as these are likely to affect meaning, and for understanding varieties of English and effects of style. It is thus one of the most fundamental concepts in linguistics. The study of semantics includes the study of how meaning is <span class="tes">constructed, interpreted, clarified, observed, illustrated, simplied negotiated, contradicted</span> and <span class="tes">paraphrased</span>.
