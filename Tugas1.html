	<p>A website, also written as <strong>Web site, Web site,</strong> or simply <strong>site,</strong> is a set of related web pages served from a single web domain. A website is hosted on at leas one we server accessible via a network such as the Internet or a private local area network through an Internet address known as a <span class="color-1">Uniform Resource Locator</span>. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the <span class="color-1">World Wide Web</span>.
	</p>
	<p>A webpage is a document, typically written in plain text interspersed with formatting instructions of <span class="color-1">Hypertext Markup Language</span> (<span class="color-2">HTML, XHTML</span>). A webpage may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable markup anchors.</p>
	<p>Webpages are accessed and transported with the <span class="color-1">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</span> (<span class="color-2">HTTP</span>), which may optionally employ encryption (<span class="color-2">HTTP Secure, HTTPS</span>) to provide security and privacy for the user of the webpage content. The user's application, often a web browser, renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto a display terminal.</p>

	<p align="right">The <span class="color-1">World Wide Web</span> (<span class="color-2">WWW</span>) was created in 1990 by CERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the <span class="color-1">World Wide Web</span> would be free to use for anyone.</p>
	<p align="right">Before the introduction of HTML and HTTP, other protocols such as <span class="color-1">File Transfer Protocol</span> and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual files from a server. These protocols offer a simple directory structure which the user navigates and chooses files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting, or were encoded in word processor formats.</p>
